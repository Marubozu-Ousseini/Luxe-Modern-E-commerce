Place your homepage hero image here as `hero.jpg` (or `hero.png`).

Vite will serve files in `public/` at the site root, so the hero image is referenced as `/hero.jpg`.

Recommended specs:
- Aspect ratio: ~16:9 or 3:2
- Size: 1920×1080 or larger (retina-friendly)
- Format: JPEG (quality ~80) or WebP for smaller size
- Subject: calm lifestyle/editorial, soft directional light

After adding the file, reload the dev server page (it should hot-reload automatically).
